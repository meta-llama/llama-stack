# This workflow should be run manually when needing to re-record tests. This happens when you have 
#  - added a new test
#  - or changed an existing test such that a new inference call is made
# You should make a PR and then run this workflow on that PR branch. The workflow will re-record the 
# tests and commit the recordings to the PR branch.
