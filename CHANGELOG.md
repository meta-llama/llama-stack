# v0.1.0
Published on: 2025-01-24T17:47:47Z

We are excited to announce a stable API release of Llama Stack, which enables developers to build RAG applications and Agents using tools and safety shields, monitor and those agents with telemetry, and evaluate the agent with scoring functions.

## Context
GenAI application developers need more than just an LLM - they need to integrate tools, connect with their data sources, establish guardrails, and ground the LLM responses effectively. Currently, developers must piece together various tools and APIs, complicating the development lifecycle and increasing costs. The result is that developers are spending more time on these integrations rather than focusing on the application logic itself. The bespoke coupling of components also makes it challenging to adopt state-of-the-art solutions in the rapidly evolving GenAI space. This is particularly difficult for open models like Llama, as best practices are not widely established in the open.

Llama Stack was created to provide developers with a comprehensive and coherent interface that simplifies AI application development and codifies best practices across the Llama ecosystem. Since our launch in September 2024, we have seen a huge uptick in interest in Llama Stack APIs by both AI developers and from partners building AI services with Llama models. Partners like Nvidia, Fireworks, and Ollama have collaborated with us to develop implementations across various APIs, including inference, memory, and safety.

With Llama Stack, you can easily build a RAG agent which can also search the web, do complex math, and custom tool calling. You can use telemetry to inspect those traces, and convert telemetry into evals datasets. And with Llama Stack’s plugin architecture and prepackage distributions, you choose to run your agent anywhere - in the cloud with our partners, deploy your own environment using virtualenv or Docker, operate locally with Ollama, or even run on mobile devices with our SDKs. Llama Stack offers unprecedented flexibility while also simplifying the developer experience.

## Release
After iterating on the APIs for the last 3 months, today we’re launching a stable release (V1) of the Llama Stack APIs and the corresponding llama-stack server and client packages(v0.1.0). We now have automated tests for providers. These tests make sure that all provider implementations are verified. Developers can now easily and reliably select distributions or providers based on their specific requirements.

There are example standalone apps in llama-stack-apps.
