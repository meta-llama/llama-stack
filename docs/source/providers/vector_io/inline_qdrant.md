# inline::qdrant

## Description


[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) is an inline and remote vector database provider for Llama Stack. It
allows you to store and query vectors directly in memory.
That means you'll get fast and efficient vector retrieval.

> By default, Qdrant stores vectors in RAM, delivering incredibly fast access for datasets that fit comfortably in
> memory. But when your dataset exceeds RAM capacity, Qdrant offers Memmap as an alternative.
