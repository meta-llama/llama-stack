The yen is divided into 100 sen, although the sen has been officially discontinued since 1967.\n\nYou can exchange your money for yen at banks, currency exchange offices, or use ATMs to withdraw cash from an ATM. Credit cards are also widely accepted in Japan, especially among major retailers and restaurants.\n\nIt's worth noting that some businesses may not accept foreign currencies other than US dollars, so it's a good idea to have some local currency on hand when traveling to Japan.",
